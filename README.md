Adds a shortcode to insert the post's featured image into the post's content.

## Description
Adds a `[post_thumbnail]` shortcode for use with wordpress post thumbnails. Size can also be set using `[post_thumbnail size="XXXX"]`. You can also call the function directly in your theme with `<?php post_thumbnail('size=thumbnail');?>`.

Just insert the shortcode into any post's content and when it will be replaced with the featured image.

This works only with the featured images introduced in WordPress 2.9.
